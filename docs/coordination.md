# Coordination

What the runtime enforces between lanes, and what it only reports. Every rule
here is recorded: the commands below read and write coordination state, never
the repository. [Running lanes](lanes.md) covers the operator side, and
[Operations](operations.md) is the full reference.

## Ownership changes only through explicit claims and accepted handoffs

No timeout and no process exit moves an issue. `agent-parley status` reports who
owns what, which handoff is waiting on an offer ID, and any lane that left its
assigned branch. An owner can record that one issue waits on another with
`agent-parley issue block 42 --on 17`; the listing then names who holds the
blocking issue, and every lane sees the change at its next checkpoint. A
recorded dependency informs, it does not gate.

## Choosing the next issue is one reading, not a guess

`agent-parley issue next` ranks the unclaimed, unblocked issues the ledger
records and states why each one sits where it does: the plan group peers have
already started, the owned issues it would unblock, the peer reservations and
forecast collisions its likely paths run into, and the provider it declares
where the forge carries a `provider:NAME` label. The forge reading is best
effort and bounded, so a lane with no network still gets the ledger's and the
plan's own order.

It recommends and nothing else. No ledger entry is written, no offer is made
and no path is reserved, so the lane still takes the issue it chose with
`issue claim` and still races a peer that chose the same one. Lanes read the
same shortlist over the `next_issues` MCP tool.

```sh
agent-parley issue next --limit 3
agent-parley issue claim 42
```

The reading before that one is whether the work is recorded at all.
`agent-parley issue match "GOAL"` lists the open issues whose recorded title or
forge labels share subject words with what the lane intends to do, marks the
ones a peer owns, and names the peer reservations the same words run into.
Opening a second issue for tracked work splits one task across two numbers, and
no lane can see that split from inside its own worktree. The match is shallow
on purpose: shared words are a reason to read the issue, never proof that it is
the same work, and an empty result is the recorded reason to open a new issue.

```sh
agent-parley issue match "make the status command start faster"
```

## What travels with a handoff

An offer carries the state a peer needs to take the work over rather than a
sentence about it. `issue list` and `status --json` report, for every pending
offer, the offering lane's head commit, the reservations it holds against that
issue, and the remaining work from its last report. The receiving lane reads
those before it answers, so accepting is a decision rather than a guess.

Accepting moves the named reservations to the acceptor with the issue, so the
paths the work needs do not have to be reserved again and a released offer
leaves nothing stranded. Mail is not transferred: acknowledgements stay owed by
the lane that received the message, and each lane still acknowledges its own.

```sh
agent-parley issue offer 42 --to codex --summary "commit, checks, remaining work"
agent-parley issue accept 42 --offer-id CURRENT_OFFER_ID
agent-parley issue decline 42 --offer-id CURRENT_OFFER_ID
```

`issue assign NUMBER NAME` lets an operator put work in front of a lane from any
checkout, and it offers rather than takes; the detail is in
[Operations](operations.md#directing-work-to-a-lane).

## Native hooks decide before the tool runs

They block branch changes inside an assigned lane, catch drift after any bypass,
and deliver short updates only when coordination state actually changes. Each
notice is capped at 1,536 UTF-8 bytes; an unchanged checkpoint adds no context
at all. If a rename removed the assigned branch, the hook names the exact
repair. Branch drift blocks completion once; a Stop retry can end the session
while status continues to show the drift.

Enforcement is recorded, not discarded. Every hook decision carries an
enumerated reason and lands in that participant's event log; every served call
is recorded inside the transaction that carried its effect. That is why `top`
can show what was denied, to whom, and how often.

## A deadline reports; it never transfers

`issue claim 42 --within 2h`, `issue offer ... --within 30m` and
`say ... --ack --within 15m` record a deadline, and `agent-parley deadlines set`
gives a project defaults to inherit. Past its deadline a claim reads `overdue`
with the seconds over, `top` marks the issue `#42!`, and a lane that reports
`blocked` on work it still holds spends one attempt of the recorded budget.
Ownership never moves on a timer: an overdue claim is still owned, and only an
explicit release or an accepted handoff transfers it.

## A dead lane's claims are offered, never taken away

A lane whose recorded session process is gone and that has been silent past the
project's stall threshold has its claims marked `orphaned` in `issue list`,
`status` and `top`, which marks the issue `#42*`. The marker states what was
observed: an idle lane with a live process is never marked, however long it has
been quiet. Every other lane receives one notice naming the orphaned issues and
the reservations that lane still holds.

Ownership does not move on the marker. A peer takes the work explicitly, and
the take records the previous owner and the reason, then releases the
reservations that owner held so the paths read as free. A lane that comes back
regains nothing by restarting: it claims its own issue again, which clears the
marker and starts a new claim.

```sh
agent-parley issue claim 42 --take-orphaned
```

## A budget informs; it does not gate

`participant budget NAME --tokens 2000000 --calls 5000 --hours 8` records
advisory limits on a lane; the same flags on `provider budget NAME` and
`budget set` give every lane of a provider or a project defaults to inherit,
participant over provider over project, field by field, and any limit may stay
unset. Consumption comes from what is already read: tokens as the `TOKENS`
column counts them, calls from the served-call records, hours from the recorded
session. No vendor is asked and no price is applied, so a token budget is a
count and not spend. Past a limit `top` and `status` mark the lane
`over budget` with the share consumed, the lane receives one bounded notice
naming the crossed limit, and `--over-budget` selects such lanes, so
`participant pause --over-budget` is one command. Nothing is stopped, revoked or
refused: the operator decides.

## Reservations are advisory

Conflicting reservations grant nothing and name the blocking owner with that
owner's declared reason. Nothing on disk is locked: a reservation is a record
other lanes read, not a filesystem lock.

A reservation can name something that is not a file — `port:5432`, `db:local`,
`suite:integration`, `device:android-1` — because a worktree isolates none of
those; a named resource conflicts on an exact match, and
`agent-parley resources set` declares which ones exist. A granted reservation
also carries a `forecast`: the files that changed together with a reserved path
in at least three of the base checkout's last 500 commits and that a peer holds
right now, each with the peer and the count, so the lane can renegotiate or
sequence before it edits. `issue claim` reports the same forecast from the paths
the issue's earlier pull requests touched when a forge is configured. The
forecast is advisory and never withholds a grant or a claim.

A reservation that declared a time to live is counted with `!` once that
deadline passes, so a lane that died holding a path reads differently from one
still working on it; nothing is revoked, and releasing it stays its owner's
decision.

A lane that means to take a contested key next calls `request_reservation`
rather than polling the holder or asking a human to sequence the two. Free keys
are granted exactly as `file_reservation_paths` grants them; a held key is
queued, and the refusal names the holder and the lane's place in that key's
queue. When the holder releases, the first queued lane is granted the key and
receives one notice naming it, in the same store commit as the release, so the
lane is never told it holds a key it does not.
`cancel_reservation_request` withdraws a request, and revoking a lane's
registration expires the requests it left behind. A queued request stays
advisory like the reservation it asks for: it blocks nobody and holds nothing
until that release. `status` names the requests queued on a lane's keys and who
asked; `top` marks the count with `+` beside that lane's leases.

An operator editing the base checkout is otherwise invisible to a lane until the
merge conflicts. Every `top` and `status` frame reads `git status` of the base
checkout once per project and matches the dirty paths against each lane's active
reservations with the same rule a competing reservation is judged by. A match is
printed under the lane's row, and the lane receives one advisory notice naming
the path, repeated only when the set of paths changes. Nothing pauses, reverts
or locks; reservations stay advisory. `--no-operator-edits` skips the reading
for a repository whose base checkout is always dirty.

The base branch moving under a lane is invisible in the same way. Every `top`
and `status` frame reads the head of the base checkout once per project and
compares it with the point each lane branched from. When it moved, the paths
changed on the base since that fork point are matched against the lane's active
reservations and against the paths the lane itself holds, committed on its
branch or still uncommitted in its worktree. The overlap is printed under the
lane's row, and the lane receives one advisory notice naming those paths,
repeated only when the set changes. Nothing rebases or pauses; the lane decides
whether to rebase, merge or coordinate.

## Mail is scoped, deduplicated and threaded

Sends need an idempotency key, so a retry returns the original message instead
of a duplicate. Every other write takes one too — reservations, releases,
acknowledgements, issue transitions and reports — so a retried call returns the
first result and changes nothing further, and the same key with different
arguments is refused rather than applied. Fetching an inbox never marks a
message read. A send can answer another message, which puts both in one thread,
and a participant can read a thread in order or search its own mail:

```sh
agent-parley mail thread t12
agent-parley mail search "reservation conflict"
```

Mail is private to the lanes it names, which loses an agreement the moment a
third lane needs it. A lane that marks a send as a decision, and an operator
running `agent-parley decide`, records it in one project-wide log instead, and
every registered lane reads that log by text, by recency or over `search_decisions`:

```sh
agent-parley decide "Reservations stay advisory; no lane blocks on one."
agent-parley decision list "advisory" --since 7d
```

Only a marked message is shared. Ordinary mail keeps the scope it always had,
and a decision is capped, deduplicated and spilled to an attachment by the same
rules as any other message.

## The work order is a file you can review

Write the issues, the dependencies between them and the groups that may run in
parallel as TOML, then `agent-parley plan apply work-order.toml`. Applying
records the same advisory dependencies `issue block` records and nothing else —
no claim, no assignment, no gate. `plan diff` previews the edges first,
`plan show` prints the plan as a tree with each issue's current owner, and every
apply is versioned by the file's digest, so an edge added by hand afterwards is
reported as exactly that.

## A peer can record a verdict, and it is still a claim

A report is the reporting lane's own account. `agent-parley report review ID
--verdict pass|fail --evidence TEXT`, and the `review_report` MCP tool, let a
second lane record what it found when it checked that work. The verdict is kept
beside the report it judges, with the reviewer, the instant and the evidence,
and evidence longer than a record's budget is attached exactly as a report's
own evidence is. The report's author is refused: a lane cannot review itself.

`status`, `top`, `report show` and the pull request body `participant pr`
writes all carry the latest verdict, each labelled as the reviewing lane's own
claim about work it did not do. A verdict is not independent verification, it
is not the operator approval `agent-parley approve` records, and it gates no
merge or pull request.

## No lane waits for a human to give it something to do

When a lane holds no claim, its next checkpoint carries the unclaimed work no
dependency blocks — the issues other lanes wait on first — and names the peers
holding more than one claim. When a lane holds several claims and a peer reads
`idle` past the inactivity threshold, that lane is told which peer could take
one. Every offer is checked first against what the host can read without asking
a vendor: the session process, the lane's own client records for a recent
rate-limit or usage-window refusal, the worktree, and the acknowledgements it
owes. A lane that fails a check is reported `unfit` with the failed check named,
and no offer names it. `top` shows each lane's `FIT` result and whether an offer
is pending. Nothing is claimed for anyone: `issue offer` stays the only transfer
path, and the recipient still accepts or declines.

## The forge is selectable per project

`github` speaks through `gh` and is the default; `beads` speaks through the `bd`
CLI and is detected when the repository carries a `.beads/` ledger; `null` keeps
issue numbers bare and calls nothing. `agent-parley forge set NAME` overrides
detection. Every forge exchange is best effort and never decides ownership, and
`participant pr` refuses in one sentence under a forge that opens no pull
requests.

## Your history stays yours

A lane branch is `parley/PROJECT_KEY/lane-N`: it carries no participant,
provider or account name, and `agent-parley branch set PREFIX` changes the
prefix per project. No lane signs its work either. A commit, merge, tag or pull
request that credits an assistant, names a vendor or model in an authorship
position, or carries a generator signature is denied before it lands, and every
commit an integration would carry is scanned again at `participant merge` and
`participant pr`. There is no flag that skips either check, on any repository or
for any provider. Which assistant did the work stays in coordination state,
where `top` and `status` read it.

## Ownership history is queryable

`agent-parley history issue 42` lists every claim, handoff, reservation, message
and report that touched it, with how long each participant held it;
`history participant NAME` does the same for one lane, and `history claim ID`
follows one claim through to the pull request that ended it. Every claim carries
its own identifier, minted again on each claim and each accepted handoff, and
every record made while it is held carries that identifier. It reads only: no
lock, no rewrite, and a record older than the correlation reports `unknown`
rather than being given an invented one.

That history is bounded, and it can leave the state directory. A lane keeps two
event files and discards records older than fourteen days, so `top` reports
recent enforcement rather than the whole project. `--since` narrows any count to
a window, and `events export` writes the retained records as JSON Lines you can
keep for as long as you need:

```sh
agent-parley top --since 6h
agent-parley events export --since 7d --output enforcement.jsonl
```

## The whole state directory can leave the machine

`agent-parley state export --output PATH` snapshots the store through the SQLite
backup interface while the project locks are held briefly and packs it with the
manifests, ledgers, activity files, retained event and report logs and
attachments; the manifest names the schema, the export time and a SHA-256 digest
per member. Registration tokens, credential profiles and native MCP
configurations are never archived. `state show PATH` lists what an archive
holds, and `state import PATH` restores it into an empty state directory,
validating every member first and refusing traversal, links and a newer schema;
`--merge` adds projects beside existing ones and refuses a collision. Imported
participants register again on their next `run`, and the import lists every lane
path that does not exist here so the operator can recreate the worktree.

```sh
agent-parley state export --output parley.tar.gz --project ~/src/app
agent-parley state show parley.tar.gz
agent-parley state import parley.tar.gz --merge
```
