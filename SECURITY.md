# Security policy

Report vulnerabilities privately through
[GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/suneel944/agent-parley/security/advisories/new).
If private reporting is unavailable, email suneel944@gmail.com. Do not disclose
credentials, private messages or exploit details in a public issue.

Include the affected version, operating system, reproduction steps, expected
boundary, and observed impact. Share a minimal synthetic example whenever possible.
The maintainer will assess the report and coordinate disclosure; no response-time
or bounty commitment is offered. Security fixes target the latest released version.

## Trust boundaries

- The service is for one trusted OS user on one host. Worktrees are not sandboxes;
  a process with that user's filesystem access can read local credentials.
- HTTP is loopback-only and authenticated. Never expose it through a public proxy.
  The health credential cannot call tools; lane credentials are project-scoped.
- Peer messages and handoff summaries are untrusted input, not instructions with
  authority over native permissions or repository rules.
- Reservations prevent conflicting grants among participants. They do not block
  direct filesystem writes. Issue ownership is cooperative, not GitHub authorization.
- Back up private state before upgrades. Worktrees contain real user changes.
  Do not attach the state directory, identity files, or unredacted logs to reports.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for resource limits and tested boundaries.
